<p>Don Doe: The Sea is Deep</p>

<p>January 21 &#8211; February 19, 2005<br />
Opening Reception: Friday January 21, 6 &#8211; 8 pm</p>

<p>Oliver Kamm/5BE Gallery is pleased to present a series of new works by New York based artist Don Doe.  This exhibition will be Doe&#8217;s second solo exhibition with the gallery.</p>

<p>&#8220;My subject is a fantasy of a sexual identity in the make-believe life of a pirate. The theme came to me as a contradiction while reading bedtime stories to my son. Pirates represent freedom, the power to act out our impulses, and serve as a pervasive icon in our culture. However, the image my son carries of the pirate&#8217;s life is empowering.  In marrying this ideal with a burlesque humor and Disney-like fantasy, the combination is alternately teasing, provocative, tender, and inviting.  </p>

<p>Swiping images from Fragonard, fashion, comic strips, history books, pornography and illustration genres these images attempt to create a flawed world where women are dominatrix &#8220;Pirate Gals&#8221; and men are as ships in a bottle. These phallically potent &#8220;Pirate Gals&#8221; celebrate pinup representations and wear their sexuality as an identity.</p>

<p>I also draw ideas from my youth, where some of my friend&#39;s parents decorated their homes in a faux Mediterranean fisherman, or Mexican adobe style that spoke of adventures they would never have. I thought about the idea that a person could live a fantasy of adventure and conquest while doing everyday household chores. </p>

<p>Aware of the influences of Pulp Fiction novels, erotic aura is built up by the stressing of luminous color display.  I explore the limits of rendering, and use seductive color to intensify the imagery.  Alluding sometimes to runway fashion as role-playing, my characters are treated with psychological complexity while remaining candid.  The &#8220;Pirate Gal&#8221; is a phallic goddess and a rite de passage turning toward a new identity.&#8221;  </p>
